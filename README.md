# Enterprise Networking: Practices and Technologies


This course gives students hands-on experience in the design, configuration and troubleshooting of networks. This course is rooted in a theoretical and technical overview of the field. General understanding of all layers of the networking stack is required. However, the focus is mainly on networking, i.e. how to make networks work and how to keep them working. Thus, routing, switching and services that support networking (e.g. DHCP and DNS) are core topics. Furthermore, the course focuses on large-scale scenarios where networking can be challenging. The course is organised around weekly practical lab sessions and lectures that complement each other. The lectures give the theoretical background while the lab sessions give the necessary hands-on experience in putting theory into practice.
